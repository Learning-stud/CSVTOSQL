# Python Script for Scraping PDF Data and Saving to MySQL

## Overview

This guide provides detailed instructions and explanations for a Python script that scrapes data from a PDF file and saves it to a MySQL database. The script uses the `PyMuPDF` library to extract text from the PDF and `mysql-connector-python` to interact with the MySQL database.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following:
- Python installed on your system.
- MySQL installed and running.
- Required Python libraries installed (`PyMuPDF`, `mysql-connector-python`).

Install the necessary Python libraries using:
```sh
pip install PyMuPDF mysql-connector-python
